## 📊 Content Quality Standards

### E-E-A-T Optimization (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- **Experience**: Real-world relocation insights, practical examples, case studies
- **Expertise**: Government-source citations, official program details, legal accuracy

- **Processing Times**: Use official government estimates, note variability

## ✍️ Tone & Voice

### Professional but Approachable
- **Expert without jargon**: Explain complex visa requirements in plain English
- **Confident but cautious**: State facts clearly, acknowledge when things change
- **Helpful not salesy**: Focus on information, not promotion

### Writing Style
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly, busy readers scanning for key info
